#create a function with one parameter that give
#out a square root of a number like 5 * 5 = 25

def square(number):
    return number * number

# Great now that you have created your new square
# method, let's put it to use.
# Under the function definition, call your new
# function and pass it the argument 3.
# Since your square function returns a value,
# create a new variable named result to store the
# value from the function call.

result =  square(3)
